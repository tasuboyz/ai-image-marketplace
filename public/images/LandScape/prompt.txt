A breathtaking snowy landscape featuring a cozy mountain village nestled in a valley. The village is composed of small wooden cabins and houses with vibrant, colorful rooftops in red, blue, green, and yellow, creating a striking contrast against the soft white snow that blankets the ground and rooftops. Surrounding the village are tall pine trees covered in snow and distant snow-capped mountains under the night sky. Above, a vivid aurora borealis dances across the sky in shades of green, purple, and turquoise, casting an ethereal glow over the scene. The sky is clear, revealing a starry backdrop that enhances the magical atmosphere. The lighting reflects off the snow, amplifying the contrast between the warm tones of the village and the cool, mystical hues of the northern lights. The overall style is cinematic and hyper-detailed, with rich colors, high contrast, and a sense of peaceful wonder â€” ideal for a stunning landscape with visual impact.

A surreal landscape with floating mountains above a glowing valley, bathed in warm golden and deep purple hues. The sky is lit by a radiant sunset with streaks of pink, orange, and red. Magical mist swirls around the mountains, and glowing crystals float gently in the air. High contrast between the dark shadows of the mountains and the vibrant sky gives it a dreamlike, enchanted atmosphere.
